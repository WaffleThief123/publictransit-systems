Running 30 miles from Hunt Valley in northern Baltimore County through downtown Baltimore to Cromwell Station/Glen Burnie and BWI Airport in Anne Arundel County, it is one of the oldest modern light rail systems in the eastern United States. The system uses former railroad rights-of-way for much of its route and runs as a street-running railway through downtown on Howard Street.",
